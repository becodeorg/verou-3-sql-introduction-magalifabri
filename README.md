## The Mission

### ðŸŒ± Must-have features

1. Get familiar with [the basics](./SQL-basics.md) and set up a database
2. Make the following tables and populate them with some dummy data (have at least two entries for every table)
    

- groups: id, name, location, start_date, max_participants
```sql
CREATE TABLE groups (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    location VARCHAR(255),
    start_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO `groups` (
    `name`,
    `location`,
    `start_date`
) VALUES (
    'elon-1',
    'Ghent',
    '2022-06-01'
), (
    'zuck-1',
    'Ghent',
    '2022-09-01'
);
```

- learners: id, name, email, active
```sql
CREATE TABLE learners (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    active BOOLEAN
);

INSERT INTO `learners` (
    `name`,
    `email`,
    `active`
) VALUES (
    'Pikachu',
    'chuchu@hotmail.com',
    1
), (
    'Squirtle',
    'squirt@hotmail.com',
    1
), (
    'Bulbasaur',
    'bulb@hotmail.com',
    1
)
```

- coaches: id, name
```sql
CREATE TABLE coaches (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO `coaches` (`name`)
VALUES ('Elon'), ('Mark');
```

3. Try the following selects

- Get all data from the groups<sup>\*</sup>
```sql
SELECT * FROM `groups`;
```

- Get the name and email of the first learner, and alias the name to learner_name<sup>\*</sup>
```sql
SELECT `name` AS 'learner_name', `email` FROM `learners` LIMIT 1;
```

4. ðŸ’© happens - a group needs to be postponed
- Update the start date of the first_group (make it two months later)<sup>\*</sup>
```sql
UPDATE `groups` SET `start_date` = '2022-08-01' WHERE `id` = 1;
```

- Introduce a new field `status` which can contain a long text indicating the reason for postponing (bonus points if it's a creative one)
```sql
ALTER TABLE `groups`
ADD `status` TEXT;

UPDATE `groups` SET `status` = 'Coach preoccupied launching rockets into space' WHERE `id` = 1;
```

5. One of the learners changed his/her mind and decided to be an astronaut

- Delete someone from the learners table<sup>\*</sup>
```sql
DELETE FROM `learners` WHERE `id` = 2;
```

### ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have (doable)

6. A learner belongs to a group, and a group has ~~a coach~~ coaches

- Find a technique to make this connection in the database (what of the field is unique to a record, so we can refer to it?)
```sql
ALTER TABLE `learners`
ADD `group_id` INT(11) AFTER id;

UPDATE `learners` SET `group_id` = 1;


ALTER TABLE `coaches`
ADD `group_id` INT(11) AFTER `id`;

UPDATE `coaches` SET `group_id` = 1 WHERE `id` = 1;
UPDATE `coaches` SET `group_id` = 2 WHERE `id` = 2;
```

7. We want all the data

- Select a coach and all related groups<sup>\*</sup>

```sql
-- Remake the database with following setup: 1 coach - many groups, 1 group - many students

CREATE TABLE groups (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    coach_id INT(11),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    location VARCHAR(255),
    start_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO `groups` (
    `coach_id`,
    `name`,
    `location`,
    `start_date`
) VALUES (
    1
    'elon-1',
    'Ghent',
    '2022-06-01'
) , (
    1
    'elon-2',
    'Brussels',
    '2022-12-01'
), (
    2
    'zuck-1',
    'Ghent',
    '2022-09-01'
);


CREATE TABLE learners (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id INT(11),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    active BOOLEAN
);

INSERT INTO `learners` (
    `group_id`
    `name`,
    `email`,
    `active`
) VALUES (
    1
    'Pikachu',
    'chuchu@hotmail.com',
    1
), (
    1
    'Squirtle',
    'squirt@hotmail.com',
    1
), (
    1
    'Bulbasaur',
    'bulb@hotmail.com',
    0
), (
    2
    'Charmander',
    'spicy@hotmail.com',
    1
), (
    3
    'Mew',
    'bubblegum@hotmail.com',
    1
);


CREATE TABLE coaches (
    id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO `coaches` (`name`)
VALUES ('Elon'), ('Mark');
```

```sql
SELECT c.name AS coach_name, g.name AS group_name
FROM groups g
LEFT JOIN coaches c ON g.coach_id = c.id
WHERE g.coach_id = 1;
```

- Select all the above, but also all learners from this group who are still active<sup>\*</sup>
```sql
SELECT c.name AS coach_name, g.name AS group_name, l.name AS learner_name
FROM groups g
LEFT JOIN coaches c ON g.coach_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN learners l ON g.id = l.group_id
WHERE g.coach_id = 1 AND l.active = 1;
```

### ðŸŒ³ Nice to have (hard)

Bonus round: try some steps again, but this time run your SQL from PHP.
You'll need to connect PHP to the database first. What techniques can you find to do so? Why do you choose one or another? Don't overthink the structure at this point, one file is enough.
